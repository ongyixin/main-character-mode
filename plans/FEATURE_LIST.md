Core demo features

These are the features I’d prioritize to make the project feel coherent, funny, and technically impressive.

1. Real-world object detection and scene understanding

User points phone camera at a room or environment

System identifies major objects in view

System classifies scene type and spatial context

Objects are converted into interactive semantic roles

Examples:

lamp → jealous poet

chair → loyal bodyguard

toaster → unstable ex

bookshelf → wise mentor or enemy fortress

2. Object personification engine

Every detected object gets:

a name

personality archetype

voice style

emotional state

relationship stance toward the user

Nearby objects can also have relationships with one another

Personalities are grounded in the object’s function and context

Examples:

office chair = clingy coworker energy

water bottle = low-maintenance but emotionally neglected

bed = seductive but destructive influence

3. Voice and text interaction with objects

User can tap an object and talk to it

Object responds in voice or text

Conversations are contextual to the object, environment, and prior interactions

Tone can be romantic, hostile, dramatic, sarcastic, absurd

Modes:

flirt

interrogate

recruit

befriend

roast

apologize

4. Relationship and memory system

Objects remember previous conversations

Relationship score changes over time

Objects can reference past events or how the user treated them

Social dynamics emerge across multiple objects

Examples:

the sofa knows you complimented the chair

the desk resents being ignored

the lamp sides with you against the printer

5. Quest and event generation

Objects can issue simple quests or challenges

Quest generation is based on detected objects and scene context

Completing quests changes object relationships or unlocks new events

Examples:

“Bring me closer to the window.”

“Ask the kettle what it knows.”

“Choose between me and the couch.”

“Survive the breakup sequence.”

6. Lightweight mini-game transformations

Certain objects or scene states trigger simple game modes

Objects become gameplay entities with assigned roles

Examples:

mug = throwable

chair = cover

lamp = turret

bookshelf = puzzle wall

vacuum = boss

Mini-game types:

target shooting

boss battle

stealth sequence

survival challenge

object-order puzzle

7. Adaptive soundtrack generation

Music changes based on:

detected environment

narrative state

user interaction

player emotion / energy

Soundtrack can shift between romantic, cinematic, suspenseful, chaotic, tragic, comedic

Examples:

soft lo-fi during casual object banter

swelling strings during confession scenes

boss music when the appliances revolt

8. Session recap and visual output

At the end of a play session, the system generates:

an episode title

a “life poster” or scene poster

relationship summaries

best quotes / dramatic highlights

Optional shareable output for social virality

Examples:

Episode 4: The Lamp That Knew Too Much

You chose the sofa. The chair will remember this.

Strong supporting features

These make the world feel richer without being essential to the first demo.

9. Multi-object social graph

Objects form alliances, rivalries, crushes, grudges

Group scenes become more dynamic

User choices affect overall room politics

10. Interaction modes / genre presets

Dating sim mode

mystery mode

fantasy mode

survival mode

workplace drama mode

soap opera mode

This lets the same object recognition system drive very different experiences.

11. Persistent world state

Room state persists across sessions

Characters evolve over time

Returning users see continuity, not reset behavior

12. Dynamic narration layer

An AI narrator frames events in real time

Narration can be dramatic, documentary-style, chaotic, or deadpan

Example:

“You turned away from the lamp. It took that personally.”

13. Emotional escalation triggers

If relationships or tension cross thresholds, special events trigger

These can cause mini-games, conflict scenes, or reality distortion

Examples:

rejection triggers heartbreak arc

object jealousy triggers argument scene

unresolved conflict triggers combat sequence

Stretch goals

These are exciting, but I would not make them mandatory for the first version.

14. Environmental distortion mode

Scene gets visually or narratively “corrupted”

Objects transform into alternate versions

Soundtrack and dialogue become more intense or surreal

Use cases:

boss phase transitions

dramatic reveals

rare chaos mode

15. Multiplayer / shared environment mode

Multiple users in one room

Shared object characters and world state

Players can compete for object affection or complete quests together

16. User avatar / player persona modeling

System adapts how characters respond based on the user’s detected mood or behavior

Confident vs awkward vs chaotic playstyles produce different reactions

17. User-generated character saving

Favorite object characters can be saved and revisited

Users build a cast of recurring “dateables” or allies

18. Social sharing and replay

Share posters, dialogue scenes, relationship drama recaps

Replay iconic moments as clips or stylized summaries

Recommended MVP

This is the version I’d actually build for a hackathon.
